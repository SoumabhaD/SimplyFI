Analysis of the functional view:
The functional view presented in the conversation outlines the end-to-end process flow involved in trade operations, particularly focusing on contract management, shipment handling, and financial aspects. Here's a breakdown of the functional view based on the conversation:

Contract Management:
•	Contracts are negotiated between customers and suppliers.
•	Contracts are counter-signed and returned.
•	Vessel nomination and agreement with vessel owners are finalized.

Shipment Handling:
•	Once contracts are finalized, shipment activities commence.
•	Vessels are arranged from the market.
•	Loading processes are monitored and updated daily.
•	Bills of Lading (BL) are generated post-loading completion.

Financial Aspects:
•	BL is sent to financial institutions for financing.
•	Purchase and sale invoices are prepared.
•	Invoice preparation includes linking to contract and LC terms.
•	Quality and quantity certificates are issued by the shipper.
•	Documents are verified by the trade and finance teams.
•	Payments are processed by the sales team on the due date.

Flows:
[Contract Management Flow]
Negotiation   ->  Counter-signing   ->   Vessel Nomination   ->   Agreement   ->   Customer Acceptance

[Shipment Handling Flow]
Vessel Arrangement   ->   Loading Monitoring   ->   BL Generation   ->   Financial Institution Processing

[Financial Flow]
BL Submission for Financing   ->   Invoice Preparation   ->   Document Verification   ->   Payment Processing

RAID Analysis:

Risks:
Contractual Risks: Risk of delays or disputes in contract negotiation and signing between customer, supplier, and company.
Operational Risks: Risks associated with vessel availability, freight costs, and dispatch rates negotiation.
Financial Risks: Risks related to financing arrangements, payment terms, and invoice processing.
Market Risks: Fluctuations in market indices affecting profitability calculations and pricing agreements.

Assumptions:
Assumption that ground-level staff accurately monitors quantity at the load port.
Assumption that vessel availability can be secured from the market.
Assumption that trade head will approve rates and freight costs.
Assumption that contracts will be counter-signed and returned promptly.

Issues:
Resource Constraints: Involvement of multiple teams with a small team size may lead to resource constraints and delays.
Process Complexity: Complexity in contract negotiations, document handling, and shipment tracking may lead to process inefficiencies.
Data Management: Challenges in managing and validating large volumes of documents and data across different teams.
Communication Gaps: Potential for miscommunication or delays in information flow between teams.

Dependencies:
Dependency on Trade Head: Approval of rates, freight costs, and contract terms depend on the trade head's decision.
Dependency on Finance Team: Processing of invoices, financial agreements, and compliance requirements rely on the finance team.
Dependency on Shipping Team: Availability of vessels, shipment tracking, and document handling depend on the shipping team's actions.
Dependency on External Factors: Market conditions, regulatory changes, and customer/supplier actions can impact project progress.
